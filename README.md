🔋 EV Battery Casing — A Material Science Study

Welcome to the repository of EV Battery Casing — A Material Science Study, an exploration of materials engineering for safer, more efficient electric vehicle (EV) battery enclosures. This study focuses on the critical role of casing in thermal management, structural integrity, crash protection, and electrical insulation.


🚀 Project Overview

The EV Battery Casing is a vital component that:

✅ Protects battery cells from mechanical impacts, vibration, and corrosion

✅ Provides thermal management and fire protection

✅ Ensures structural integrity and electrical insulation

✅ Supports lightweight, durable, and manufacturable design for modern EVs

Our material science analysis compares different casing materials with respect to these goals.


🧠 Key Topics

Material requirements: Lightweight, stiff, fire-resistant, corrosion-resistant, crash-protective, cost-effective

Material types studied:

Aluminum alloys (e.g., Al A390) — Lightweight, corrosion-resistant, good thermal conductivity

High-strength steel — Superior impact resistance, durable, cost-effective

Carbon Fiber Reinforced Composites (CFRC) — High strength-to-weight ratio, corrosion-resistant, flexible in design
